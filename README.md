This is the repo for The Metamorphosis: Automatic Detection of Scaling Issues for Mobile Apps.

dVermin contains three phases, which are view mapping, inter-view inconsistent analysis and intra-view inconsistent
analysis. This implementation will analyze the three view trees and the corresponding view image of three scale size
combinations. This implementation is mainly in `dVermin.py` file.
